"i [SEP] I have to admit that I like hot and spicy foods and can tolerate a bit of heat so when I tried this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JRMG98"">Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce, 8-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> sauce I already knew it would not provide the kick I enjoy so that is not a factor in this review.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this sauce did have a nice jalapeno flavor and a creamy texture more akin to salad dressing than to sour creme.  I've used this sauce as a dip on chips as well as on entree foods such as burritos and quesadillas and found it pleasant enough even though there does seem to be a slight thickener feel if too much is applied -- almost like a non-fat salad dressing.<br /><br />For a very mild touch of jalapeno flavor this sauce is fine but it's easily overpowered with highly spiced foods.  The sauce, however, does temper those same spices and creates a nice rich body to whatever you're eating.  One thing that I did find to be a bit off was that the sauce has a sweetness to which I feel is unnecessary.<br /><br />So a mixed bag here but both not unpleasant.<br /><br />You won't get a blast of jalapeno flavor with this condiment but you will get a rich creamy taste with each bite.

"energy bars [SEP] So are energy bars the new fad of eating? Perhaps taking milk out of the equation has led to people finding other sources of energy besides a bowl of sugared cereals. Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of ""keeping up"" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular ""healthiest"" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless.",1,1,energy bars,"So are energy bars the new fad of eating?

Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of ""keeping up"" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular ""healthiest"" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste.

There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless."

There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me. The back of the box says ""4g of fiber*"". So I am looking around for the qualifier this asterisk is referring to. It is not immediately available, but I see underneath the green balloon where it says ""4g of fiber"" it reads: ""3g of total fat"". I say confusing because it is above, rather than below, but also because I dont know how fiber relates to fat, unless the most of the fiber comes from the oils. Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless."

Perhaps others know better.<br /><br />My knee-jerk reaction to this product was that it was just a ploy to ursurp ""organic"" energy bars, but for what it's worth, this is a tasty and seems relatively nutritious. I dont know all of the negatives of every little ingredient like sorbate 60 or sorbitan monostereate. These ingredients might ward off purists, but for the casual person looking to lighten their snack intake would find this a good supplement.<br /><br />I don't think the product is intended or sold as ""health food"", but the packaging certainly is on the misleading side, unless one examines it well enough. Even though there is nothing on the product that suggest health outside of its benefits of fiber and protein content, that alone should not be the decision maker. I give this item 3 stars for taste. It is enjoyable. Nothing revolutionary, but tasty nonetheless."
"it [SEP] So are energy bars the new fad of eating? Perhaps taking milk out of the equation has led to people finding other sources of energy besides a bowl of sugared cereals. Companies like Kellogs I am sure had to find some means of ""keeping up"" by reconstituting their own brands. Special K, perhaps their most popular ""healthiest"" cereal has come up with this Granola Bar which advertises 4 grams of Fiber and 4 grams of protein. While they advertise the benefits, one should not glare over the fact that this is a ""chocolatey peanut butter"" bar.<br /><br />A serving size is one (1) bar which is 110 calories. There are 2 grams of saturated fat, 85 miligrams of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. The number one ingredient is ""solluble corn fiber"", which to the brief research I checked out, seems to have some health benefits, particularly in digestion. Most of the ingredients should be known to people. Lots of different kinds of oils, which probably are attributed to the fat content. The box says ""chocolatety"", but there is no actual chocolate in the product, so its a concoction made from other ingredients. For better or worse. Cocoa has risen in cost, so many products that only rely on flavor of chocolate are not using actual chocolate anymore.<br /><br />There is one thing that is confusing for me.
